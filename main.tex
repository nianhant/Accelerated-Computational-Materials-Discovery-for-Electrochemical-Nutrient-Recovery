\section{Introduction}
% Growing global interest in sustainable methods for nutrient recovery from wastewater.
% Challenges in identifying materials that are stable and efficient under experimental electrochemical conditions.
With a rapidly growing global population, the demand for ammonia-based fertilizers continues to increase, placing additional strain on the nitrogen cycle. Traditionally, nitrogen-based fertilizers are produced from ammonia synthesized through the Haber-Bosch process, which remains vital for the sustainability of agricultural productivity \cite{Schloegl2003CatalyticStory}. However, the Haberâ€“Bosch reaction operates at high temperatures (250 to 400~$^\circ$C) and pressures (100 to 300~bar) \cite{Smil1999DetonatorExplosion,Erisman2008HowWorld, Lim2021Ammonia2050,Verleysen2021HowStorage}, relies on fossil-derived hydrogen, and leaves a significant carbon footprint \cite{Liu2022ProspectsFixation, Smil1999DetonatorExplosion,Suryanto2021NitrogenShuttle}. In contrast, organic waste from sewage and farms offers an alternative resource for reduced nitrogen\cite{ChipocoHaro2024ElectrocatalystsConversion,Adebayo2004EvaluationFingerlings,Mulchandani2016RecoverySludges}, which constitutes 15\% of total nutrients in the sludge\cite{Xiao2020ProteinReview, Thomsen2017ChangesSludge}. The organic matter dissolved in sludge includes nucleic acids, humic acids, proteins and polysaccharides\cite{Jung2002RecoverabilityWastewater}. Electrochemical methods, such as the electrolysis of waste-activated sludge (EWAS), offer a more sustainable pathway to recover nitrogen while mitigating environmental impacts operating at low temperature\cite{Botte2024InnovativeRecovery,Vedharathinam2014ExperimentalMedium,Alvarez-Pugliese2024PerspectivesWaste, Zeng2019ElectrochemicalSulfide,Ye2016ElectrochemicalProduction}. 

Existing EWAS methods rely on high applied cell voltages, ranging from 5 to 30~V, to drive oxidation and nitrogen transformation in sludge. This results in the formation of reactive oxygen species, which often compete with nitrogen species for active sites on the electrode surfaces. Although Jafari et al.\cite{JafariElectrochemicalProduction} explored lower-voltage electrolysis to mitigate these side reactions, the resulting systems suffered from low current density (<30~mA~cm$^{-2}$) and low yield (<5$_{\rm mass}\%$)\cite{Zhao2022AAmmonia}. Therefore, the development of efficient, robust catalysts that can operate at mild voltages without sacrificing performance remains a key challenge for EWAS.

A major limitation of EWAS lies in the stability of the catalyst under nitrogen-rich and oxidative conditions. Elevated potentials accelerate electrode corrosion and dissolution\cite{Sanchis2022NitrateOverview,Popov2015ThermodynamicsCorrosion,Kapaka2010ElectrochemicalElectrode,Mucalo2004InSolutions,Aksu2001ElectrochemistrySolutions,OConnor2018ElectrochemicalSolutions}, while competition between nitrogen oxidation and OER further degrades catalytic performance~\cite{Li2021Ru-DopedNitrate,Wang2022ElectrochemicalOxidation,Dai2020ElectrochemicalOxides}. Reactive nitrogen species, such as ammonia (\ce{NH3}), glycine, and cyanide (\ce{HCN}), can form metal-ligand complexes that promote leaching and surface degradation~\cite{Bjerrum1957StabilitySubstances,Meng1996PrinciplesReview,Wang2022AmmoniaSystem}. While metal leaching in ammonia, cyanide, and glycine solutions has been extensively studied in hydrometallurgy~\cite{Meng1996PrinciplesReview,Wang2022AmmoniaSystem,Han1974AMMONIA-AMMONIUMNODULES,Bhuntumkomol1982TheSolutions,Azadi2021SustainableGlycine,Oraby2020GoldPermanganate,Sarvar2023ApplicationStructure,SPARROW1995CyanideApplications,Akcil2015PreciousReview}, these studies differ significantly from EWAS conditions, where ligand concentrations are lower and variable electrochemical driving forces influence material stability. Therefore, a systematic understanding of catalyst stability in nitrogen-rich environments under reducing and oxidative potentials in alkaline conditions is crucial for the development of efficient and sustainable electrodes.

Pourbaix diagrams provide a valuable framework for predicting electrode stability by mapping dissolution, passivation, and oxidation regimes as a function of pH and applied potential~\cite{PourbaixAtlasSolutions}. Traditionally used in corrosion studies~\cite{McCafferty2010ThermodynamicsDiagrams, Stack2005BridgingDiagrams,Pourbaix1973LecturesCorrosion}, Pourbaix diagrams help identify stable operating conditions where catalyst dissolution is minimized. Most of the available diagrams account primarily for interactions with hydrogen ions\cite{Huang2017ImprovedCompounds,Wang2020PredictingFunctional,Huang2015ElectrochemicalCalculations,Cao2020E-pHLaterite}, so extending them to nitrogen-containing ligands is necessary to provide insight into material stability under EWAS conditions. In hydrometallurgy, Pourbaix diagrams have been adapted to study metal leaching in nitrogen-containing solutions~\cite{Meng1996PrinciplesReview,NasuhaYahya2019ThermodynamicDiagram,Barragan2021LeachingOptimization,OConnor2018ElectrochemicalSolutions,Seke2006EffectSphalerite}. However, the direct application of these diagrams to electrocatalyst stability remains limited, due to the high concentration of nitrogen ligands, and the high temperatures and pressures used for metal leaching. Integrating Pourbaix stability analysis with computational and experimental validation can accelerate the identification of durable catalysts for EWAS.

Minimizing electrode dissolution is critical to ensuring both the sustainability of electrochemical oxidation and the safety of recovered fertilizers. In this study, we apply Pourbaix diagrams to EWAS, focusing on stability under nitrogen-rich conditions. By systematically analyzing potential-pH stability regions, we establish a computational framework for catalyst screeningâ€”highlighting stability as a key design criterion alongside activity and selectivity. This approach provides a pathway for developing robust and sustainable catalysts for electrochemical nitrogen recovery.


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Pourbaix Diagram Construction}
Pourbaix diagrams were constructed to map the thermodynamic stability regions of bulk metals/alloys and their metal-ligand complexes in the presence of nitrogen-containing ligands at concentrations in the range expected to be present in EWAS.
%under electrolysis of waste activated sludge (EWAS) potentials in basic environment. 
Free energies of bulk metals were obtained from the Materials Project database \cite{Jain2013TheInnovation}, based on generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Free energies for aqueous ligands and metal-ligand complexes were calculated from equilibrium constants sourced from standard thermochemical handbooks \cite{Wagman1982TheUnits, Smith1989CriticalConstants, Bard2017StandardSolution, Bjerrum1957StabilitySubstances} and literature \cite{Meng1996PrinciplesReview, Azadi2019DataComplexes, Aviles2022ExploringNH3, Oraby2023SelectiveSolutions, Harrington2005DeterminationIon}. We focus here on metal elements that are commonly used as electrode materials and those where metal-ligand complex stabilities are available: Au, Cu, Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, Ti, Zn, Ag, Cd, Sr, Pt, Pd and Fe. The aqueous ligands considered in this study include \ce{NH3-}, glycine and \ce{CN-}. The targeted experimental potential ranges from -2.0-2.3 V (vs RHE) and the pH ranges from 11.5-13.5, but Pourbaix diagrams are constructed over a wider range for reference.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction}
aA + h\text{H}^+ + z\text{e}^- \leftrightarrow bB + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\end{equation}

The diagrams were constructed based the framework introduced by previous studies \cite{PourbaixAtlasSolutions, Huang2017ImprovedCompounds,Huang2015ElectrochemicalCalculations,Singh2017ElectrochemicalMaterials,Patel2019EfficientCompounds,Persson2012PredictionStates}. All reaction species, i.e. metals, alloys, oxides, aqueous ions and ligands, and water are connected by corresponding reactions. Then the reaction chemical potentials are derived from equilibrium relationships between species, using the Nernst equations, as a function of applied potential and pH. For a redox reaction shown in Equation~\eqref{eq:reaction}, the Nernst equation is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:nernst} E = E^\circ - \frac{k}{z} \log \left(\frac{A^a}{B^b}\right) - \frac{k \cdot h}{z} \text{pH}, \end{equation}

where \(E\) is the cell potential at non-standard conditions, \(E^\circ\) is the standard electrode potential, and $k$ is defined as \(k = \frac{RT}{F} \cdot \frac{1}{\ln 10}\). \(A\) and \(B\) are the activities of the reactants and products, and \(z\) is the number of electrons transferred. \(a\), \(b\) and \(h\) are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants, products, and protons, respectively. Aqueous ion activities are assumed to be 10$^-4$ M. Ligand concentrations are set to be representative of experimental conditions and are specified in the captions of each diagram. 

The Pourbaix diagrams were generated by evaluating the chemical potentials of all species across a finely spaced potential-pH grid (4000 $\times$ 4000 points) and identifying the most thermodynamically stable species at each grid point. The thermodynamic stability of each species was calculated by comparing chemical potentials at each grid point across the potential-pH space. Stability regions were identified for bulk metals, aqueous ions, and metal-ligand complexes. 


\subsection{Incorporation of Nitrogen Ligands}
To extend the Pourbaix framework to systems containing nitrogen-based ligands (\ce{NH3}, glycine, and \ce{CN-}), ligand concentrations are represented as pLigand in Equation~\eqref{eq:pligand} and incorporated into pH-dependent mass balance equations, assuming that the sum of the concentrations of protonated and deprotonated species is kept constant. For example, the dissociation equilibrium of \ce{NH3} (Equation~\eqref{eq:NH3 equilibrium}) indicates the relationship between pH and p\ce{NH3} via Equation~\eqref{eq:pNH3}:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:NH3 equilibrium}
\ce{NH4+} \leftrightarrow \ce{NH3} + \ce{H+}
\end{equation}
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:NH3_total}
% [\text{NH}_3]_{\text{total}} = [\text{NH}_3] + [\text{NH}_4^+]
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pNH3}
\text{pNH}_3 = -\log \left([\text{NH}_3]_{\text{tot}}\right) + \log \left(1 + 10^{pK_a - pH} \right), \quad pK_a = 9.26 \cite{NationalCenterforBiotechnologyInformation2025PubChemHSDB}
\end{equation}

Similarly, glycine and \ce{CN-} concentrations were calculated using Equations~\eqref{eq:pGly} and~\eqref{eq:pCN}, respectively:
\begin{align} \label{eq:pGly}
\text{pGly} &= -\log \left([\text{Gly}_{\text{total}}]\right) + (pK_{a_1} - pH) \nonumber \\
&\quad + \log \left(1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a_1}} + \frac{1}{10^{pH - pK_{a_2}}} \right), \nonumber \\
&\quad pK_{a_1} = 2.37, \quad pK_{a_2} = 9.8 \cite{2025PubChemGlycine.}
\end{align}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pCN}
\text{pCN}^- = -\log \left([\text{CN}^-]_{\text{tot}}\right) + \log \left(1 + 10^{pK_a - pH} \right), \quad pK_a = 9.2 \cite{USEPA1980AmbientCyanides}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pligand}
\text{pligand} = -\log[\text{ligand}].
\end{equation}

The interdependence of pH and ligand concentration (e.g., due to \ce{NH3} equilibrium in Equation~\eqref{eq:NH3 equilibrium}) was modeled using these equations, which also include the assumption that ligand concentrations are unaffected by other ligands or external factors. For example, when both \ce{NH3} and \ce{CN-} were present, their equilibrium concentrations were treated as independent functions of pH.

All code for producing the Pourbaix diagrams is available...

\textcolor{red}{The sections below should be re-organized and added to the "pure metals" sub-section. I think 1-2 paragraphs of discussion for each metal is appropriate. There should also be 1-2 paragraphs of "intro" describing which metals we specifically discuss and which ones are relegated to the SI.}
% Add metal-H2O to visualize how N-ligands affect corrosion.
The constructed Pourbaix diagrams for Ni, Pd, Cu, Ti, and Pt are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Ni_Pourbaix}, \ref{fig:Cu_Pourbaix}, \ref{fig:Pd_Pourbaix}, and \ref{fig:Ti_Pt_Pourbaix}, respectively. The ion activity is set to \num{10e-4}M. The targeted operating potential is from -2 to 2V vs RHE, due to pulsing, and the pH ranges from 11.5 to 13.5. Stability domains of aqueous species, including metal ions and metal-ligand complexes, within this region indicate the likelihood of electrode corrosion under thermodynamic equilibrium. 

\subsection{Nickel (Ni) Stability and Corrosion Behavior}
The Pourbaix diagram for Ni (Figure \ref{fig:Ni_Pourbaix}) reveals distinct immunity, passivity, and corrosion regions, which are significantly influenced by the presence of nitrogen-containing ligands. In pure aqueous environments (\ce{H2O}), Ni remains corrosion-resistant at oxidative potentials up to 2~V vs. RHE and pH values as high as 13. However, glycine (\ce{Gly}) complexes with Ni, forming \ce{[Ni(Gly)3^-]}, which can lead to dissolution into the solution. The effect of cyanide (\ce{CN^-}) is even more pronounced, as even at a low concentration of \num{1e-4}~M, the formation of \ce{[Ni(CN)4^2-]} becomes thermodynamically favorable within the targeted potential and pH range. Given that the experiment operates with pulsing potentials alternating between reductive and oxidative states, Ni corrosion into cyanide complexes appears inevitable. Due to the toxicity of cyanide\cite{Bhattacharya2009CyanideTreatment}, Ni electrodes should be avoided for EWAS applications.


\subsection{Copper (Cu) Stability and Corrosion Behavior}
Similarly, Cu exhibits strong resistance to corrosion in aqueous environments, maintaining stability at oxidative potentials and alkaline pH up to 14, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Cu_Pourbaix_H2O}. However, its passivation can be significantly affected by the presence of glycine as a complexing agent\cite{Wang2022ThermodynamicDiagrams,Tripathi2009FundamentalConstituents,Skrypnikova2008PeculiaritiesAdditives,OConnor2018ElectrochemicalSolutions}. The copper passivation can still occur at pH values $>$ 9, dependending on the glycine concentration. Since EWAS conditions likely involve high amino acid concentrations, glycine-induced Cu dissolution is still foreseeable if the operating condition is less alkaline. Moreover, even low concentrations of \ce{CN^-} ligands lead to Cu dissolution, with the formation of stable \ce{[Cu(CN)3]^2-}, particularly under pulsing potential conditions. To utilize Cu as an electrode, the solution composition must be carefully controlled to minimize corrosion and prevent toxic cyanide complex formation.

% Similarly, Cu exhibits excellent resistance to corrosion under aqueous conditions, even at oxidative potentials and alkaline pH up to 14, from Figure \ref{fig:Cu_Pourbaix_H2O}. However, the stability regions of Cu and its oxides correspondingly decrease with the addition of N-ligands\cite{Wang2022ThermodynamicDiagrams}. At higher glycine concentration, insert higher figure, Cu is more prone to corrosion, with a smaller stability domain. Since EWAS is highly likely to operate under high amino acid concentration, high glycine concentration in the solution is foreseeable. Similar to Ni, small concentration of \ce{CN-} ligands can result in corrosion of Cu in the targeted operation domain. The stable formation of \ce{[Cu(CN)3]^2-}, in Figure \ref{fig:Cu_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN}, is likely due to the pulsing potential. Therefore, to use Cu as the electrode, we have to adjust the solution composition carefully to avoid corrosion of the electrode and formation of toxic cyanide complexes. 

\subsection{Palladium (Pd) Stability and Cyanide Complex Formation} 
% discussion on Pt and Pd. Controversies over Pt and Pd CN complexes stability constants. Display Pt CN with new stability constants here. 
The Pourbaix diagrams for Pd (Figure \ref{fig:Pd_Pourbaix}) indicate that at the targeted \ce{NH3} and glycine concentrations, Pd remains stable across the operating potential and pH ranges. While Pd can form glycine complexes, these are thermodynamically weak, with low stability constants for \ce{[Pd(Gly)^+]} and \ce{[Pd(Gly)2]}. As a result, Pdâ€™s immunity and passivity regions remain largely unaffected by glycine and ammonia ligands. However, even at a low \ce{CN^-} concentration of \num{1e-4}~M, Pd stability decreases significantly due to the formation of \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} (Figure \ref{fig:Pd_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN}).

Notably, the reported stability constants for \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} vary widely, with values ranging from $log\beta_4 = 42.2$\cite{Smith1989CriticalConstants} to $log\beta_4 = 63$\cite{Cabbiness1969MacrocyclicComplexes}. The Pourbaix diagram in Figure \ref{fig:Pd_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN} is based on an updated stability constant of $log\beta_4 = 62.3$, as determined by Harrington et al.\cite{Harrington2005DeterminationIon}. Harringtonâ€™s study suggests that earlier stability constant values, such as $log\beta_4 = 42.4$ reported by Smith et al.\cite{Smith1989CriticalConstants}, were inaccurate due to incorrect electrochemical potential measurements. Given these uncertainties and the high cost of Pd electrodes, avoiding conditions that promote \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} formation is advisable.

% Constructed Pd Pourbaix diagrams are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Pd_Pourbaix}. Pd-Gly complex reference. The targeted \ce[NH3] and glycine ligand concentration does not have an affect on Pd's stability in the targeted potential and pH ranges. Glycine ligands can complex with Pd but they are not very thermodynamically stable, resulting in low stability constants of \ce{[Pd(Gly)^+]} and \ce{[Pd(Gly)2]}. Therefore the immunity and passivity region of Pd is not affected by addition of \ce{NH3} and glycine ligands. On the other hand, a small concentration of \ce{CN-} ligands at \num{1e-4}M can decrease the stability domain of Pd over the targeted potential and pH values, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Pd_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN}. This figure is generated by using an updated stability constant of \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} $log\beta_4=62.3$ by Harrington et al.\cite{Harrington2005DeterminationIon}. Due to experimental setup and conditions to determine the stability constants of this tetracyano complex, different stability constants ranging from 42.2\cite{Smith1989CriticalConstants} to 63\cite{Cabbiness1969MacrocyclicComplexes} have been reported. The Pourbaix diagram of Pd using the more widely referenced stability constant $log\beta_4=42.4$ by Smith et al.\cite{Smith1989CriticalConstants} is shown in Figure 
% \ref{fig:Pd_Pourbaix_Smith1989CriticalConstants_SI} of SI. This value is deemed incorrect by Harrington et al. because the electrohcemical potentials recorded corresponding to this value was not the equilibrium potentials. The stability region of \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} is rather small at this stability constant, and Pd seems to be resistant to corrosion in the targeted potential and pH ranges. However, given the potential incorrectness in the study where the stability constant is obtained, and the cost of Pd electrodes, it is best to avoid the thermodynamically stable formation of the \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} complexes in aqueous solution.
\subsection{Platinum (Pt) Stability and Cyanide Complexation} 
The Pourbaix diagram for Pt in the presence of \ce{NH3} and \ce{CN^-} ligands is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Pt_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN}. No reliable stability constants for \ce{Pt^2+}-glycine complexes have been found\cite{Kiss1991CriticalGlycine}. The stability constant for \ce{[Pt(CN)4^2+]} is reported as $log\beta_4 = 41$\cite{Smith1989CriticalConstants}, but this value is debatable, as it was determined under non-equilibrium conditions\cite{Hancock1976FormationTetrakiscyanopalladate2-}. Spectrophotometric studies suggest a much higher value, likely between 65 and 75. Using an estimated stability constant of $log\beta_4 = 70$, the Pourbaix diagram in Figure ~S2 shows that \ce{[Pt(CN)4^2+]} forms across a wide pH range, overlapping with the pulsing potential range (-2 to 2~V). Given its planar, diamagnetic structure, \ce{[Pt(CN)4^2+]} is among the most stable cyanide complexes\cite{Griffith1962CyanideMetals}. As with Pd, the high cost of Pt and potential corrosion in cyanide-containing solutions make it an unsuitable electrode for EWAS.

% \ref{fig:Pt_Pourbaix_Harrington_SI}

% The Pourbaix diagram of Pt with \ce{NH3}, and \ce{CN-} ligand concentrations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Pt_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN}. No \ce{Pt^2+}-glycine complex stability constant has been found\cite{Kiss1991CriticalGlycine}. The stability constant of \ce{[Pt(CN)4^2+]} used here is 41\cite{Smith1989CriticalConstants}, which is also debatable since the recorded potential was not the equilibrium potential\cite{Hancock1976FormationTetrakiscyanopalladate2-}, the same source of error in the study of \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]}. No exact value has been reported due to difficulties in determining very large stability constants. However, spectrophotometric study indicated that the $log\beta_4$ value for \ce{[Pt(CN)4^2+]} is much larger than 41, between 65 and 75. The Pourbaix diagram of Pt-\ce{NH3}-glycine-\ce{CN-} with the approximated \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} stability constant of 70 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Pt_Pourbaix_Harrington_SI}. The \ce{[Pt(CN)4^2+]} stability domain can cover a wide range of pH, from acidic to alkaline. The stability domain also overlaps with the pulsing potential from -2 to 2V, which may cause corrosion of electrode in this region, thermodynamically. The \ce{[Pd(CN)4^2+]} complex is planar and diamagnetic, indicating a high degree of stability due to the strong bonding between \ce{Pt^2+} and the cyanide ligands\cite{Griffith1962CyanideMetals}, which stabilizes the low oxidation state of Pt. Similar to Pd, due to the high cost of material and experimentation with potential Pt corrosion into aqueous ions, Pt is not a thermodynamically stable electrode for EWAS. \ce{Ni^2+}, \ce{Pd^2+}, and \ce{Pt^2+} cyanide complexes are all planar and diamagnetic, which are among the most stable cyanide complexes \cite{Griffith1962CyanideMetals}.

\subsection{Titanium (Ti) Stability and Suitability for EWAS}
The Pourbaix diagram for Ti in aqueous solution with glycine ligands is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ti_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN}. No stable \ce{Ti^2+}-\ce{NH3} or \ce{Ti^2+}-\ce{CN^-} complexes have been reported\cite{Griffith1962CyanideMetals, Nicholls1980ComplexTitanium}. The diagram includes the stability constants of \ce{[Ti(Gly)^-]} and \ce{[Ti(Gly)_2^+]}, but glycine concentration does not significantly impact Ti's passivity over the targeted potential and pH range. Due to its ability to form a stable passive oxide layer\cite{Kiss1991CriticalGlycine, PourbaixAtlasSolutions}, Ti is highly corrosion-resistant, with limited experimental evidence of dissolution\cite{Schmidt2009AqueousVoltammetry, Ziemniak1993SolubilityTemperatures, Knauss2001TiIV300C, Schmidt2006DissolutionEffect, Pocsi1988ComplexAcid}.

While Ti oxides have low electronic conductivity, modifications such as MXenes\cite{Gardon2013ImprovedSpray, Naguib2012Two-DimensionalCarbides, Hui2022VacancyBatteries} and doped perovskites like \ce{SrTiO3}\cite{Sokolov2024ComputationalTitanate} offer enhanced conductivity. Thus, Ti-based materials, particularly modified oxides, are promising candidates for EWAS electrodes due to their corrosion resistance and potential for electronic conductivity enhancement.

% Ti Pourbaix diagram under aqueous condition with glycine ligands is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ti_Pourbaix_NH3_Gly_CN}. Since no stable Ti-\ce{NH3} or Ti-\ce{CN-} complexes has been reported\cite{Griffith1962CyanideMetals, Nicholls1980ComplexTitanium}, the construction of this Pourbaix diagram only considers the stability constants of [\ce{Ti(gly)^-}] and [\ce{Ti(gly)_2^+}]. Due to the formation of stable passive oxide layer on Ti\cite{Kiss1991CriticalGlycine, PourbaixAtlasSolutions}, there is very limited experimental studies on dissolution of Ti ions\cite{Schmidt2009AqueousVoltammetry, Ziemniak1993SolubilityTemperatures,Knauss2001TiIV300C,Schmidt2006DissolutionEffect} and \ce{Ti^3+}-glycine complexes\cite{Farooq1970StudiesAminoacids, Pocsi1988ComplexAcid}. The glycine concentration has no affect on passivity regions of Ti over the wide range of potential and pH values. Therefore, Ti oxides can be an excellent corrosion resistant material for electrode for EWAS. Undeniably titanium oxide as a semiconductor might have poor electronic conductivity, titanium based materials have shown to have enhanced electronic conductivity, including MXenes\cite{Gardon2013ImprovedSpray,Naguib2012Two-DimensionalCarbides,Hui2022VacancyBatteries} and \ce{SrTiO3}\cite{Sokolov2024ComputationalTitanate}.

\section{Conclusion}
This study evaluates the stability of Ni, Cu, Pd, Pt, and Ti electrodes under EWAS conditions using Pourbaix diagrams, revealing the significant influence of nitrogen-containing ligands on metal corrosion behavior. While Ni and Cu exhibit strong resistance in aqueous environments, they become highly susceptible to dissolution in the presence of \ce{CN^-} ligands, necessitating careful solution composition control to prevent electrode degradation and contamination. Pd and Pt remain largely unaffected by glycine and ammonia but are vulnerable to cyanide complexation, with uncertainties in reported stability constants further complicating their viability. Given their high cost and instability in cyanide-rich environments, Pd and Pt are not ideal for EWAS applications. In contrast, Ti maintains excellent corrosion resistance due to its passivating oxide layer, making it the most promising candidate despite its low electronic conductivity, which can be addressed through conductive Ti-based materials. These findings highlight the importance of integrating stability considerations into electrode design, ensuring durability and minimizing contamination risks in electrochemical nutrient recovery systems.

% Pourbaix diagrams of metal-\ce{NH3}/glycine/\ce{CN-}-\ce{H2O} are generated and discussed to identify thermodynamic behavior of an ideal material what can be used as an electrode in EWAS. The dissolvation behavior of various electrode under oxidizing potentials and high N-ligand concentrations was well explained by these pourbaix diagrams. The stability regions of build Ti and it oxides compared with other metals present its thermodynamically stability under such conditions. 
% \subsection{Outline}



% \subsection{References}

% The class makes various changes to the way that references are
% handled.  The class loads \textsf{natbib}, and also the
% appropriate bibliography style.  References can be made using
% the normal method; the citation should be placed before any
% punctuation, as the class will move it if using a superscript
% citation style
% \cite{Mena2000,Abernethy2003,Friedman-Hill2003,EuropeanCommission2008}.
% The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the use of the various citation
% commands of that package: \citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown
% something, in \citeyear{Cotton1999}, or as given by
% Ref.~\citenum{Mena2000}.  Long lists of authors will be
% automatically truncated in most article formats, but not in
% supplementary information or reviews \cite{Pople2003}. If you
% encounter problems with the citation macros, please check that
% your copy of \textsf{natbib} is up to date. The demonstration
% database file \texttt{achemso-demo.bib} shows how to complete
% entries correctly. Notice that ``\latin{et al.}'' is auto-formatted
% using the \texttt{\textbackslash latin} command.

% Multiple citations to be combined into a list can be given as
% a single citation.  This uses the \textsf{mciteplus} package
% \cite{Johnson1972,*Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo1994}.
% Citations other than the first of the list should be indicated
% with a star. If the \textsf{mciteplus} package is not installed,
% the standard bibliography tools will still work but starred
% references will be ignored. Individual references can be referred
% to using \texttt{\textbackslash mciteSubRef}:
% ``ref.~\mciteSubRef{Eisenstein2005}''.

% The class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography.  These
% should be given in place in the document \bibnote{This is a note.
% The text will be moved the the references section.  The title of the
% section will change to ``Notes and References''.}.  As with
% citations, the text should be placed before punctuation.  A note is
% also generated if a citation has an optional note.  This assumes that
% the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if
% this is not the case \cite[p.~1]{Cotton1999}.

% \subsection{Floats}

% New float types are automatically set up by the class file.  The
% means graphics are included as follows (Scheme~\ref{sch:example}).  As
% illustrated, the float is ``here'' if possible.
% \begin{scheme}
%   Your scheme graphic would go here: \texttt{.eps} format\\
%   for \LaTeX\, or \texttt{.pdf} (or \texttt{.png}) for pdf\LaTeX\\
%   \textsc{ChemDraw} files are best saved as \texttt{.eps} files:\\
%   these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be\\
%   converted to \texttt{.pdf} files easily using \texttt{eps2pdf}.\\
%   %\includegraphics{graphic}
%   \caption{An example scheme}
%   \label{sch:example}
% \end{scheme}

% \begin{figure}
%   As well as the standard float types \texttt{table}\\
%   and \texttt{figure}, the class also recognises\\
%   \texttt{scheme}, \texttt{chart} and \texttt{graph}.
%   \caption{An example figure}
%   \label{fgr:example}
% \end{figure}

% Charts, figures and schemes do not necessarily have to be labelled or
% captioned.  However, tables should always have a title. It is
% possible to include a number and label for a graphic without any
% title, using an empty argument to the \texttt{\textbackslash caption}
% macro.

% The use of the different floating environments is not required, but
% it is intended to make document preparation easier for authors. In
% general, you should place your graphics where they make logical
% sense; the production process will move them if needed.

% \subsection{Math(s)}

% The \textsf{achemso} class does not load any particular additional
% support for mathematics.  If packages such as \textsf{amsmath} are
% required, they should be loaded in the preamble.  However,
% the basic \LaTeX\ math(s) input should work correctly without
% this.  Some inline material \( y = mx + c \) or $ 1 + 1 = 2 $
% followed by some display. \[ A = \pi r^2 \]

% It is possible to label equations in the usual way (Eq.~\ref{eqn:example}).
% \begin{equation}
%   \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \, r^2 = 2r \label{eqn:example}
% \end{equation}
% This can also be used to have equations containing graphical
% content. To align the equation number with the middle of the graphic,
% rather than the bottom, a minipage may be used.
% \begin{equation}
%   \begin{minipage}[c]{0.80\linewidth}
%     \centering
%     As illustrated here, the width of \\
%     the minipage needs to allow some  \\
%     space for the number to fit in to.
%     %\includegraphics{graphic}
%   \end{minipage}
%   \label{eqn:graphic}
% \end{equation}

% \section{Experimental}

% The usual experimental details should appear here.  This could
% include a table, which can be referenced as Table~\ref{tbl:example}.
% Notice that the caption is positioned at the top of the table.
% \begin{table}
%   \caption{An example table}
%   \label{tbl:example}
%   \begin{tabular}{ll}
%     \hline
%     Header one  & Header two  \\
%     \hline
%     Entry one   & Entry two   \\
%     Entry three & Entry four  \\
%     Entry five  & Entry five  \\
%     Entry seven & Entry eight \\
%     \hline
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% Adding notes to tables can be complicated.  Perhaps the easiest
% method is to generate these using the basic
% \texttt{\textbackslash textsuperscript} and

% In addition there are very limited amount of aqueous Ti ions in the solution. There are very limited studies on the dissolution of Ti in aqueous condition at ambient temperature \cite{Schmidt2009AqueousVoltammetry, Ziemniak1993SolubilityTemperatures,Knauss2001TiIV300C,Schmidt2006DissolutionEffect}, due to its small equilibrium solubility, due to uncertainties of wether Ti ions existed in aqueous solutions. Caglioti et al. \cite{Caglioti1960ComplexitySolutions} investigated dissolved Ti species in aqueous phase and found that \ce{TiO^2+} is the only aqueous species present even at highly acidic condition at pH=0.40. The strong acidity of \ce{Ti^4+} and \ce{Ti^3+} exceeds that of HCN, which hinders the formation of titanium cyanide complexes in aqueous solutions \cite{Nicholls1980ComplexTitanium, Griffith1962CyanideMetals}, therefore no stability constants of titanium cyanide complexes can be found in literature.

% Importance of Stability in Materials Discovery
% In particular, operating under nitrogen-rich conditions at oxidative potentials can accelerate the corrosion and dissolution of electrode materials, posing a significant challenge to long-term sustainability~\cite{insert_citation}. Competition between nutrient electrolysis and side reactions, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), further compromises catalyst selectivity and induces surface oxidation or passivation, leading to activity loss over time~\cite{insert_citation}. Additionally, the presence of reactive nitrogen species, such as ammonia (\ce{NH3}), glycine, and cyanide (\ce{HCN}), can lead to complex metal-ligand interactions that promote leaching and destabilization of the catalyst surface~\cite{insert_citation}. While extensive studies have investigated metal leaching in ammonia, cyanide, and glycine solutions for hydrometallurgical applications~\cite{Meng1996PrinciplesReview,Wang2022AmmoniaSystem,Han1974AMMONIA-AMMONIUMNODULES,Bhuntumkomol1982TheSolutions,Azadi2021SustainableGlycine,Oraby2020GoldPermanganate,Sarvar2023ApplicationStructure,SPARROW1995CyanideApplications,Akcil2015PreciousReview}, few studies have explored the degradation mechanisms of electrode materials under EWAS conditions, where nitrogen-containing ligands coexist with applied electrochemical potentials and competing redox reactions. Given the distinct differences in operating conditionsâ€”such as lower ligand concentrations, neutral to alkaline pH, and the presence of electrochemical driving forcesâ€”direct extrapolation from hydrometallurgical studies is not feasible. Therefore, a systematic understanding of catalyst stability under these electrochemical conditions is essential to develop robust materials that can withstand prolonged operation.

% The thermodynamic stability of electrode materials in electrochemical systems is traditionally analyzed using Pourbaix diagrams~\cite{PourbaixAtlasSolutions}, which map the phase stability of solid bulk species and solvated aqueous ions as a function of applied potential and pH. These diagrams serve as a powerful tool for predicting material dissolution, passivation, or stability under electrochemical operating conditions~\cite{insert_citation}. In corrosion studies, Pourbaix diagrams are widely used to identify optimal applied potentials and pH regimes where materials remain stable without significant dissolution, ensuring the longevity of electrodes in electrochemical devices~\cite{insert_citation}. Additionally, they reveal passivating regions where bulk metals can form protective oxide layers that prevent further degradation from oxidative attack. However, most available Pourbaix diagrams primarily account for interactions with hydrogen ions and neglect the impact of nitrogen-containing ligands, limiting their applicability in high-nitrogen environments relevant to electrochemical nutrient recovery~\cite{insert_citation}.

% In hydrometallurgy, Pourbaix diagrams have been extended to study metal leaching in the presence of nitrogen-containing ligands, such as ammonia, glycine, and cyanide~\cite{Meng1996PrinciplesReview}. These studies provide valuable insights into metal-ligand complexation and dissolution mechanisms; however, they are typically conducted under high-temperature and high-concentration leaching conditions, which differ significantly from the mild electrochemical conditions of EWAS. Nonetheless, leveraging Pourbaix diagrams that incorporate nitrogen-containing ligands can help predict electrode stability in nutrient recovery systems, guiding catalyst design by identifying compositions that balance stability, activity, and selectivity~\cite{insert_citation}.


% Electrode dissolution must be minimized to ensure that electrochemical oxidation remains a sustainable approach for nitrogen recovery and that the resulting fertilizers are free from toxic metal contaminants. In this study, we apply Pourbaix diagrams to electrochemical waste sludge oxidation, focusing on the potential and pH ranges pertinent to nutrient recovery. By generating and analyzing stability maps under these conditions, we aim to establish a computational framework for screening materials based on stabilityâ€”a crucial yet often overlooked criterion in electrocatalysis.

% A systematic understanding of catalyst stability under these electrochemical conditions is essential for developing robust materials that can withstand prolonged operation. Pourbaix diagrams provide valuable thermodynamic insights into potential dissolution pathways, passivation regimes, and the formation of stable oxides or hydroxides under various pH and applied voltage conditions~\cite{insert_citation}. By integrating computational modeling with experimental validation, researchers can identify catalyst compositions that optimize both activity and resilience in nitrogen-rich electrochemical environments~\cite{insert_citation}. Addressing these stability issues will enable the design of next-generation electrocatalysts with enhanced durability, ensuring that electrochemical nutrient recovery becomes a viable and scalable alternative to conventional nitrogen production methods.

% Difference in nitrogen concentration conditions between hydrometallurgy and electrochemical recovery.

% The thermodynamic stability of materials under electrochemical conditions can be described by Pourbaix diagrams \cite{PourbaixAtlasSolutions}. Pourbaix diagrams demonstrate the relative stable regions of solid bulk species and solvated aqueous ions as a function of applied potential and pH. These diagrams help identify the effect of electrochemical experimental parameters on material's phase stability [insert citation]. In corrosion studies, Pourbaix diagrams are used to identify optimal applied potentials and pH such that electrodes are stable and will not dissolve. These diagrams also help find passitating regions where bulk metals can form a metal oxide layer that prevents further surface attack by oxygen in the solution, or induced by oxidizing potentials. Most available Pourbaix diagram studies of electrochemical system only account for the affect of the ionic activity of hydrogen, so the stability of bulk materials under these conditions cannot be directly used to identify stable regions of electrode under high nitrogen containing ligand concentrations. In hydrometallurgy studies, Pourbaix diamgrams are used to identify optimal conditions for metal leaching to recover rare or toxic metals from ores. Recent work has extended these diagrams to metal leaching induced by nitrogen-containing ligands such as ammonia\cite{Meng1996PrinciplesReview}, glycine and cyanide. Although these studies are typically conducted under conditions of high temperature and high leaching solution concentration, which differ significantly from those relevant to electrochemical nutrient recovery, Pourbaix diagrams that cover the effect of N-containing ligands can be used to identify electrode stability and accelerate catalyst design by focusing on stable compositions. 


% Through this work, we present a material screening strategy that integrates stability, activity, and selectivity to identify materials capable of efficient and selective nitrogen recovery from organic waste. By leveraging computational insights and thermodynamic stability analysis, this study provides a pathway toward designing robust and sustainable catalysts for electrochemical nutrient recovery.
